// Brute Force Solution

// 	•	Definition: Tries all possible options to solve a problem.
// 	•	Characteristics: Simple but inefficient; high time complexity.

// Better Solution

// 	•	Definition: Improves upon brute force by reducing the number of computations.
// 	•	Characteristics: More efficient; uses smarter algorithms or optimizations.

// Optimal Solution

// 	•	Definition: The most efficient solution possible for the problem.
// 	•	Characteristics: Best time and space complexity; often uses advanced techniques or algorithms.
